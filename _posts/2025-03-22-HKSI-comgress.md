On 29 March 2025, members of the School of Biomedical Sciences (SBS) participated in a crash course organized by the Hong Kong Association of Clinicians in Training (HKACT). This association is committed to nurturing aspiring clinicians, from preclinical students to housemen, by helping them unlock their potential and craft personalized career paths.

A workshop on “Examining spatial gene expression during embryonic development using whole mount in situ hybridisation” was led by Prof. Zhao Hui. Students gained hands-on experience in handling zebrafish embryo and xenopus embryos staining.

Additionally, Prof. Alfred S.L. Cheng shared his inspiring journey in biomedical sciences, offering valuable insights and motivation to the budding clinicians in attendance.

This year, the event also featured a tour of the Core Laboratories’ facilities. Through this programme, attendees were exposed to medical research, honed practical research skills, and gained a richer understanding of how research intersects with clinical careers.
