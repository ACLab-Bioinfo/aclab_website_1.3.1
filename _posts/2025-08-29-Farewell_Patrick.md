We bid farewell to Patrick, who has been an integral part of our lab family as both a PhD student and research assistant. We're excited to congratulate him on his new position as a postdoctoral researcher at PolyU.

Patrick has made significant contributions to our lab through his work in bioinformatics and experimental research. Beyond his academic achievements, he became known as our unofficial "ticket master" â€“ thanks to his incredible skill at securing concert tickets, many of us had the chance to enjoy amazing shows like Eason Chan and Jay Chou.

Patrick's humor and kindness have brightened our lab environment. He's been a wonderful colleague who always brought positive energy to our team.

We'll miss having Patrick around, but we're thrilled to see him advance in his academic career. We wish him all the best as he embarks on this new chapter at PolyU and look forward to hearing about his future successes.
