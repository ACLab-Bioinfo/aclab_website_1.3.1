Prof. Alfred Cheng, alongside team members Patrick, Lingyun, and Yalin, represented our laboratory at the prestigious 2024 AACR Annual Meeting. Held from April 5th to 10th at the San Diego Convention Center, this gathering is a cornerstone event organized by the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR).

The AACR continues its relentless pursuit to prevent and cure all cancers. As the world's first and largest cancer research organization, it boasts a membership exceeding 54,000 professionals from more than 130 countries. These members are at the vanguard in the global battle against cancer.

During the meeting, our team had the opportunity to present a poster showcasing our latest research findings. This was not only a platform for us to disseminate our work but also a fertile ground for sharing ideas and engaging in thought-provoking discussions with researchers from around the world.

In addition to the scientific exchanges, Prof. Alfred Cheng laced up his running shoes for a cause closely entwined with our professional commitments. He took part in the #Runners4Research 5K Run/Walk, an event that combines the spirit of community and healthy living with the goal of supporting cancer research.
