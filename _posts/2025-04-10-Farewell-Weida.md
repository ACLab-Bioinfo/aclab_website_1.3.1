We bid farewell to our Research Assistant Weida. 

During his time with us, Weida has been an invaluable team member—helpful, kind, and diligent in processing clinical samples and maintaining our laboratory. Beyond his technical contributions, Weida also help organize group activities that strengthened our team bonds. While we will miss his contributions and friendly presence, we extend our heartfelt gratitude for his service and wish him a bright future in his next endeavors.
