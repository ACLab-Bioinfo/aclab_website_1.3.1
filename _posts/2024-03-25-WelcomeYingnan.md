We are delighted to announce that Yingnan Lin has joined our laboratory as a research assistant, bringing his expertise to our ongoing exploration of the 3D genome. Yingnan will be an integral part of our team, focusing on 3D genome methodology and unraveling the intricacies of genome organization and its impact on gene regulation. His contributions will help us further our understanding of the spatial configuration of the genome and its role in cellular processes.

We are excited to have Yingnan on board and look forward to the valuable insights he will bring to our research endeavors.
