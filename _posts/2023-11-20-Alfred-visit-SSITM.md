CUHK Emeritus Professor CHO Chi Hin, the Honorary Director of South Sichuan Institute of Translational Medicine (SSITM), along with Prof. CHAN Leung Franky and Prof. CHENG Sze-lok Alfred from CUHK SBS and other experts, visited the SSITM in November 2023.

They first visited Life Science Popularization Museum, a place promoting, showcasing, and providing a recreational experience of cellular life. This museum, with a total area of about 700 square meters, heavily uses advanced technologies like holographic projections, 3D curved screens, rail TVs, multimedia touch screens, AR, and VR to enable immersive experiences and learning about cell biology and its role in human aging, diseases, and regeneration.

Next stop is 2023 Health and Talent Development Themed Salon, where the experts participated in activities and shared their insights. The event included welcoming speeches and a keynote address from various officials and university representatives. Post-event, interviews were conducted to discuss topics such as industry development, talent cultivation, and research translation.
