On 22 February 2025, Prof. Alfred S.L. Cheng, Professor of the School of Biomedical Sciences at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), hosted about 40 students from New Asia Middle School during the CUHK Experiential Day. This event was part of the NAvigation Buddy Programme 2024-25, organized by New Asia College.

The students visited the Lo Kwee-Seong Integrated Biomedical Sciences Building, where Prof. Cheng introduced them to the BSc in Biomedical Sciences programme and shared insights from his own research journey. His engaging presentation inspired the young visitors to consider future careers in biomedical sciences. Additionally, postgraduate students from Prof. Cheng’s research team offered personal accounts of their academic and research experiences, giving the secondary school students a glimpse into the exciting possibilities that lie ahead.

The visit included a tour of the School’s Core Laboratories, showcasing cutting-edge research equipment and facilities. Under the guidance of Prof. Cheng’s postgraduate students, the visitors also enjoyed a hands-on experience conducting experiments.

It was our pleasure to provide these secondary school students with a meaningful and educational experience. The event underscored the School‘s commitment to nurturing the next generation of scientists.
