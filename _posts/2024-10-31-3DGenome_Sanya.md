Our lab members recently participated in The 11th International Symposium on 3D Genomics. Prof. Cheng delivered an insightful presentation on "Role of Epigenomic Reprogramming in Immunotherapy Resistance of Hepatocellular Carcinoma," sharing the lab's latest findings in cancer research.

Yingnan and Siyun also attended the symposium. We are pleased to announce that Siyun received the Third Prize Poster Award, demonstrating the high quality of research conducted in our laboratory.

This symposium provided valuable opportunities for scientific exchange and networking with leading researchers in the field of 3D genomics.
