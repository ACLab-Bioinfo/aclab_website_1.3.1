The students of BSc in Biomedical Sciences Programme took part in the Summer Undergraduate Biomedical Research Attachment (SUBRA) 2025.

Running from May to August, the eight-week program allowed students in their junior years to work to experience biomedical research in a practical, hands-on setting while being supervised by their research mentors, and enabled them to learn various laboratory techniques, maximise their potential, and think about prospective career paths.

The program culminated in a poster presentation event on 22 August 2025. Big congratulations to Jophy on winning the silver award at the poster presentation! 

We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to Liu Yan for her dedicated guidance and support for helping Jophy achieve this outstanding result.
