We’re excited to congratulate him on his new position as a postdoctoral researcher at PolyU.</p>

<p>Patrick has made significant contributions to our lab through his work in bioinformatics and experimental research. Beyond his academic achievements, he became known as our unofficial “ticket master” – thanks to his incredible skill at securing concert tickets, many of us had the chance to enjoy amazing shows like Eason Chan and Jay Chou.</p>

<p>Patrick’s humor and kindness have brightened our lab environment. He’s been a wonderful colleague who always brought positive energy to our team.</p>

<p>We’ll miss having Patrick around, but we’re thrilled to see him advance in his academic career. We wish him all the best as he embarks on this new chapter at PolyU and look forward to hearing about his future successes.</p>

So proud of you!</p>

<p>Charmaine conducted her Final Year Project (FYP) in our lab and has been exceptionally talented throughout her research journey. She masterfully acquired bioinformatics analysis skills along with numerous experimental techniques, independently completing both single-cell analysis and spatial transcriptomics analysis. We wish Dr. Charmaine all the best in her future endeavors!</p>

<p>Another FYP student, Michelle, is under the supervision of Prof. Long. She is involved in our immunology project and has acquired numerous experimental techniques and skills. She is hardworking and smart. We are so happy to know that she won the HKPFS award and will continue her research studies at HKU. We wish her all the best and hope she enjoys her research journey!</p>

<p>The Capstone Research Project Seminar was held on 16 April. This seminar showcases the Capstone Research Project, which is an experiential learning requirement for BSc in Biomedical Sciences Programme students who have chosen to concentrate on Biomedical Research in their senior year. Students are required to conduct a year-long research project under the supervision of a PI from the School and present their research findings at the Capstone Research Project Seminar.</p>

<p>We always welcome undergraduate students to join our lab for summer internships or FYP projects. Prof. Cheng and Prof. Long will arrange research projects where students can become deeply involved and learn research skills from our postgraduates, covering both experimental and bioinformatics!</p>
