CU Medicine uncovers the keys for liver cancer adaptation to immunotherapyLiver cancer remains one of the most common cancers in the world. Recent research from CUHK s Faculty of Medicine has discovered how liver cancer cells adapt to immunotherapy, the most advanced therapy for cancer patients. The team empowered immunotherapy by counteracting the resistance mechanisms of cancer cells and confirmed their clinical potential in liver cancer animal models. Research results have been published in the leading international journal Gut. The team is also going to commence a new Phase II clinical trial of combination immunotherapy, aiming to translate the discovery into patient benefits.Click here for more details.">

The JRS aims to promote collaboration between researchers and research teams in Hong Kong and the mainland by complementing the existing strengths of both sides, while the CRS aims to support larger-scale collaborative research across disciplines and universities in the mainland and Hong Kong, with a view to enhancing the research output and impact of both.CUHK s Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Sham Mai-har said, The NSFC RGC Schemes serve as catalysts that link researchers and research teams from Hong Kong and mainland China together to unlock new frontiers of knowledge. It brings me great joy to witness that CUHK researchers are engaged in high-calibre collaborative projects with their mainland counterparts.

      <p data-search="Liver cancer remains one of the most common cancers in the world. Recent research from CUHK s Faculty of Medicine has discovered how liver cancer cells adapt to immunotherapy, the most advanced therapy for cancer patients.The team comprising the School of Biomedical Sciences SBS members Prof. Alfred Cheng Sze-lok, Professor; Prof. Zhou Jingying, Assistant Professor and Dr. Xiong Zhewen, Postdoctoral Fellow and other researchers empowered immunotherapy by counteracting the resistance mechanisms of cancer cells and confirmed their clinical potential in liver cancer animal models. Research results have been published in the leading international journal Gut, which can be viewed HERE. The team is also going to commence a new Phase II clinical trial of combination immunotherapy NCT05873244 , aiming to translate the discovery into patient benefits.Recently, immunotherapy has increasingly been given to patients in the clinic. However, checkpoint inhibitors, the most used immunotherapy in liver cancer, can only benefit approximately 20 of patients. Moreover, patients who initially respond can become resistant during treatment.Immunotherapy-resistant liver cancer patients are associated with an immunosuppressive cold tumour microenvironment. However, the animal models commonly used in the laboratory do not reflect the complex organ-specific aspects of tumour development. Advances in modelling dynamic tumour-immune interactions are therefore critical to understand resistance mechanisms and improve immunotherapy. The new clinically relevant mouse models are instrumental in identifying and verifying actionable targets for therapeutic interventions. The team has further used their new mouse models to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of a novel class-I HDAC drug in combination with checkpoint inhibitors.The related coverage by the Communications and Public Relations Office, CUHK and CU Medicine can be viewed HERE and HERE respectively, whereas a report by TVB can be found HERE.
